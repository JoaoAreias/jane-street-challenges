These are the codes I wrote to solve [Jane Street Bug Byte challenge](https://www.janestreet.com/bug-byte/?utm_source=sponsorship&utm_medium=youtube&utm_campaign=computerphileapril):
- janestreet.mnz: Minizinc model to solve the Satisfiability constraint problem which narrowed down to 2 solutions that I could solve by inspection
- solution.png: Image with the values from the solution filled in
- solution.ipynb: Code to find the shortest path
